# Tweetful Angular

## Getting Setup

1. Navigate to the desired folder where you want the repo to live
2. Clone the repository on your local machine:
  - `git clone https://github.com/bencodezen/Tweetful-Angular.git`
3. Start a simple HTTP server in the repo folder
  - If you have Python installed, you can use the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
  - Another alternative is npm's `http-server` which works as well
4. Access the corresponding localhost to get the site up and running!
  - In the previous example, you would go to `localhost:8080`
